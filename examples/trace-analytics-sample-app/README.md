# Trace Analytics Sample App

This is a demo that is built to demonstrate the Trace Analytics feature that is supported by Open Distro For Elasticsearch. For the demo we have mock e-commerce app which consists of a group of microservices. This demo uses OpenTelemetry libraries to produce trace data and uses Data Prepper to ingest data into ODFE. 
 
## Run

### Required

* Docker - we recommend allowing Docker to use at least 4 GB of RAM in Preferences > Resources.

### Demo

```
docker-compose up -d
```


* Wait for 5 mins, this is because we spin up multiple python services, elasticsearch and kibana. 

* Navigate to localhost:8089


## Architecture

Below is the architecture of the mock ecommerce app.

![High-level Diagram](HighLevelDiagram.png)

There is one client file:
- client.py

The following are the backend services running on different ports:
- inventoryService.py -> 8082
- databaseService.py -> 8083
- paymentService.py -> 8084
- authenticationService.py -> 8085
- recommendationService.py -> 8086
- orderService.py -> 8088
- analytics-service -> 8087
- otel-collector -> 55680 
- transformation-instance -> 9400.

The following are the database/storage we run on different ports.
- mysql -> 3306
- elasticsearch -> 9200,9300

The client makes API calls that produces the APM data that falls into the following trace groups:

- load_main_screen
- client_checkout
- client_create_order
- client_cancel_order
- client_delivery_status
- client_pay_order

Correspondingly, on the server side, the API calls are as follows

- /server_request_login (autheticationService:8085) -> /recommend (recommendationService:8086) -> /read_inventory (inventoryService:8082) -> /get_inventory (databaseService:8083) -> mysql
- /checkout (paymentService:8084) -> /update_inventory (inventoryService:8082) -> /update_item (databaseService:8083) -> mysql
- /update_order (orderService:8088) -> /add_item_to_cart or /remove_item_from_cart (databaseService:8083) -> mysql
- /clear_order (orderService:8088) -> /cart_empty (databaseService:8083) -> mysql
- /get_order (orderService:8088) -> /get_cart (databaseService:8083) -> mysql
- /pay_order (orderService:8088) -> /cart_sold (databaseService:8083) -> mysql

Each API call in the chains above calls `/logs (analytics-service:8087)` in the analytics service.

Trace data is sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector which then exports traces to an instance of Data Prepper. This sample app contains a lightweight DNS server to handle custom hostname resolution, enabling multiple Prepper instances to be found under the same hostname. Any hostnames not resolvable by the DNS server are forwarded to Docker's embedded DNS at 127.0.0.11.

## Run

To run this application together with client:
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```
