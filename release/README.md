2. From the root project, run  `./gradlew clean :release:<platform>:<platform>WithJDKDistTar -Prelease`
3. Successful build should generate the tar in `release/<platform>/build/distributions/` directory
4. Generated tar includes a script file which can be used to execute the situp using 
```
tar -xzf situp-<platform>-jdk-<VERSION>.tar.gz
./situp-<platform>-jdk-<VERSION>/situp-tar-install.sh <CONFIG FILE LOCATION>
```
